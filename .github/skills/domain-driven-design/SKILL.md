## Meaning of "Capability"

A **capability**...

- is a domain concept (a noun)
- is a cohesive set of domain behaviors centered around a single domain concept
- comprises a set of operations (commands, queries)
- contains services that encapsulate domain logic
- evolves with the domain concept
- applies the Single Responsibility Principle

Capabilities are created automatically when the first action within them is created.

A capability should not exist without at least one action.

## General rule for extracting capabilities from paths

Given a domain path like: `internal.network.devices.execute`

Use this rule:

> Find the last noun before the verb

That noun (`devices`) is the capability.

Everything before the verb is the capability path.

Verbs tend to be like:

```text
audit
configure
create
delete
execute
export
get
import
list
monitor
provision
render
reporting
sync
update
```

## Structure

A capability folder contains domain objects & services, plus actions:

```text
/<domain>/
  models/...         <- persisted domain state
  rules/...          <- pure domain logic (no side effects)
  templates/...      <- shared templates for the whole domain
  errors.py          <- domain-specific exceptions
  <utility>.py       <- domain mechanics (side effects allowed)
  <verb>_<noun>/     <- entrypoint to a domain action
    templates/...    <- optional action-specific templates
    command|query.py <- depends on data access requirements
    errors.py        <- optional domain-specific exceptions
    handler.py       <- implements the action logic
```

**Example command.py:**

```python
@dataclass
class CreateCapabilityCommand:
  pass
```

When using HTTP/1.1, commands must be invoked using the POST method.

**Example query.py:**

```python
@dataclass
class ListCapabilitiesQuery:
  pass
```

When using HTTP/1.1, commands may be invoked using either POST or GET methods (POST is required for sufficiently large queries).
