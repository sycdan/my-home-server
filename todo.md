# Today's Task

We need to work on [create action](mhs/actions/create_action/logic.py)

The goal is to enable rapid development of new users actions -- assuming every action the user can take is in the form of a named request, and has a response of some sort (could be empty, but we can have a placeholder for it in case they want to add something).

I believe I have outlined the flow [in the readme](README.md), but ask me if anything is unclear or you think my proposal does not make sense.
