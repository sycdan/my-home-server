# Today's Task

Harden action system.

## Recommended Pre-reading

Read the `.github` instructions.

Look at [this test](tests/mhs/create_action/test_logic.py) to learn about creating actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

Each action created should generate a corresponding test_logic.py file in a mirrored directory in `./tests`.

Existing actions should have matching logic tests.

Test coverage for logic.py files should provably be as near to 100% as we can get without huge effort.

A test_log.py template should exist and its existence verified by testing.
